# Python-Instacart

## Introduction

Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to do shopping online with the touch of a button.
The Instacart stakeholders want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They are most interested in the
variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. Understanding the different mix of your
customers is the key to any successful business.

## Key Questions

The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

<li> The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
<li> They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
<li> Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
<li> Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
<li> The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
<li> What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
<li> Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
<li> Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
<li> Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.
<li> What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
<li> What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## Data Overview

The data is a public dataset that was released by Instacart in 2017. It is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3
million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. Accessed
